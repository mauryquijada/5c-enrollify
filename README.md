5C Enrollify
============

Available at 5capps.com/enrollify.

A nifty tool that polls Portal (for the Claremont Colleges scheduling system) every fifteen minutes and texts you if the enrollment numbers for a class have changed.

Inspired by Sean Adler's course-api (github.com/sean-adler/course-api).
